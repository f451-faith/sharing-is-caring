It was through the activities of the movement, begun in Zagreb in 1961, and its supporting institution the Galerija suvremene umjetnosti that the “thinking machine” was adopted as an artistic tool and medium. Pursuing the idea of “art as visual research,” the New Tendencies movement proceeded along a path that led from Concrete and Constructivist art, Op art, and Kinetic art to computer-generated graphics, film, and sculpture.\n\nWith their exhibitions and conferences and the 1968 launch of the multilingual, groundbreaking magazine , the New Tendencies transformed Zagreb—already one of the most vibrant artistic centers in Yugoslavia—into an international meeting place where artists, engineers, and scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain gathered around the then-new technology. For a brief moment in time, Zagreb was the epicenter of explorations of the aesthetic, scientific, and political potential of the computer.\n\nThis volume documents that exhilarating period. It includes new essays by Jerko Denegri, Darko Fritz, Margit Rosen, and Peter Weibel; many texts that were first published in New Tendencies exhibition catalogs and _Bit International_ magazine; and historic documents. More than 650 black-and-white and color illustrations testify to the astonishing diversity of the exhibited artworks and introduce the movement’s protagonists. Many of the historic photographs, translations, and documents are published here for the first time. Taken together, the images and texts offer the long overdue history of the New Tendencies experiment and its impact on the art of the twentieth century.","http://marcell.memoryoftheworld.org/Margit%20Rosen/A%20Little-Known%20Story%20About%20a%20Movement,%20a%20Magazine,%20and%20the%20Computer's%20Arrival%20in%20Art_%20New%20Tende%20(3901)/A%20Little-Known%20Story%20About%20a%20Movement,%20a%20M%20-%20Margit%20Rosen.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/676725801","ZKM Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, and MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2011","http://www02.zkm.de/bit/"

Looking back in time and forward into the future, the exhibition displays artists’ extraordinary ability to narrate and build empathy around fundamental global conflicts and injustices, and provide the radical imaginaries of care and solidarity that can stimulate their resolution. The venue, Kunstnernes Hus (The Artists’ House, Oslo) has a symbolic value, since the institution has played a recurrent part in Norway’s own contribution to artistic solidarities – from presenting Pablo Picasso’s Guernica in 1938 during its international solidarity tour, to organising exhibitions of solidarity with other parts of the world. The exhibition also presents central instances of Norwegian solidarity artistic practices, as well as new works especially commissioned for the exhibition.\n\nThe case studies included in the exhibition have been sourced across four continents, and cover a 70-year time span of artistic creativity. The exhibition proposes that the solidarity imaginaries expressed by art works, and embodied by specific artistic actions, are always the outcome of the extensive processes of artist-led care-building that precede and succeed them. Moreover, it is those very networks of personal connectivity and empathy created by artists over time around a particular issue (in alliance and in friendship with everyday citizens and activists) and configured within their art works of solidarity, that inspire society at large to imagine life differently and step-forward in ways that generate profound transformation.","https://kunstnerneshus.no/uploads/Actions-of-Art-and-Solidarity-exhibition-booklet.pdf","","Kunstnernes Hus, Oslo, January 2021","https://kunstnerneshus.no/en/exhibitions/oca-art-solidarity"

Eastern Europe is one of the few places where archival records have been made public, and they reveal how these agencies acted to “undermine” and “eliminate” dissident artists. To achieve this objective, however, the agents themselves sometimes had to become “performance artists.”\n\nBuilding on in-depth research into the archival records of secret services in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Germany, this publication shines a light on the files which the secret services of these countries kept about such artists. It showcases instances of artistic subversion and agent infiltration, some of which have not been disclosed before, while more recent works demonstrate that the issue of ramping up intelligence gathering operations in politics and everyday life is highly topical. This catalogue includes an introduction, a glossary explaining secret service terminology, entries on the relevant works of art, and background information on all of the files presented.","https://hmkv.de/files/hmkv/ausstellungen/2019/AGENTS/05_Publikation/HMKV_AGENTS_Magazin_DE-EN.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/1202042124","Kettler, Dortmund, 2019","https://www.hmkv.de/exhibition/exhibition-detail/preview-artists-agents-performance-art-and-secret-services.html"

The work symbolized Beuys’ idea of the expanded concept of art and of social sculpture. “Everyone is an artist” is his famous motto –not because everyone can paint, dance or make music, but because we all contribute through our productivity to a collective creativity that can be weighed as real capital and societal potential, to which Beuys ascribed the formula “art = capital.” Honey as the “spiritual nutrition of the cosmos” (Beuys) is the embodiment of this collective creativity.\n\nThese days, we deliver our creative “honey” voluntarily to internet companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok or Amazon. Computers and smartphones, online speakers and fitness wristbands upload a large portion of our data to these companies’ servers. Even rental bikes and e-scooters collect our location data. Our every click, every Like, every photo posted and every online comment is fuel for the companies of “surveillance capitalism” (Shoshana Zuboff). They use our data to sell advertising, predict our behavior, optimize their algorithms and AI, and to keep competing companies out of the market as much as possible.\n\nThe exhibition _Journey Into a Living Being_ takes its name from a lecture Beuys gave on social sculpture at documenta. It traces the conceptual trajectory to the present, in which the internet and social media are replete with offers of creative services, but where only few reap the financial rewards. It brings together artworks spanning forty years with the aim of deciphering what has come to pass between the development of social sculpture and the rise of platform capitalism and the gig economy, and how this process is reflected in art.","https://monoskop.org/images/2/23/Journey_Into_a_Living_Being_From_Social_Sculpture_to_Platform_Capitalism_2020.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/1154156506","Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien, Berlin, 2020","https://www.kunstraumkreuzberg.de/programm/eintritt-in-ein-lebewesen-von-der-sozialen-skulptur-zum-plattform-kapitalismus/"

Working with a still-shadowy underground fraternal organization, Ra amassed a library of books on the occult, Egyptology, race studies, Theosophy, and religion—all in service of drawing elliptical connections between these disparate bodies of knowledge. This work became the foundation of the personal mythology Ra employed in the 1960s when he began fronting his Myth-Science Arkestra and started drawing attention from more mainstream jazz fans.\n\n_Pathways to Unknown Worlds_ presents a kaleidoscopic range of materials from those years, including original record cover designs and production materials, paper ephemera, and photographs.

The book unites the diverse forms of expression in an impressive collage. The artists of documenta X are introduced in a number of artist’s inserts. A provocative, enlivening and thoroughly current reader and reference work for anyone interested in the art and culture of our times.\n\nSince 1955, the documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany, has served as the world’s most important forum for contemporary art. This year’s series of interlocking exhibitions, conferences, performances, lectures, and – notably – publications will be the tenth documenta and the last of this century. Organized by the respected French curator Catherine David, documenta X is conceived as a manifestation culturelle including a program entitled “100 Days – 100 Guests” that will host an exceptional group of international figures. Acknowledging both the significance of its position at the end of the century and the dramatic aesthetic, technological, and political challenges facing culture in the future, Catherine David has carefully structured the programming for documenta X around two themes: first, a critical reflection on the development of culture since 1945, and, second, an interdisciplinary dialogue about the need for new categories of critical and political discourse. The question where culture stands today in the world serves as the focal intersection of these two organizing themes. Each previous documenta has had a profound impact on the art world: documenta X promises to serve as a genuinely international forum for artists, writers, and thinkers from all disciplines.\n\nConversations with: Benjamin Buchloh, New York; Andreas Branzi, Milan; Etienne Balibar, Paris; Jacques Rancière, Paris; Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, New York Original contributions by: Peter Bürger, Bremen; Daniel Defert, Paris; Fabrizio Gallanti, Genoa; Serge Gruzinski, Paris; David Harvey, Baltimore; Masao Miyoshi, San Diego; Peter Noller and Klaus Ronneburger, Frankfurt; Hans-Joachim Ruckhaeberle, Berlin; Saskia Sassen, New York; Paul Sztulman, Paris, and others.","https://monoskop.org/images/2/2b/Documenta_X_The_Book_Politics_Poetics_1997.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/813339852","Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit, 1997",""

Drawing on the vast array of visual material made available by the Weimar Republic’s burgeoning illustrated press, Brandt’s photomontages relied upon the technologies of modern visual culture to challenge pictorial conventions, to denounce the dangerous side of modern technology that had become so apparent in the First World War, and to image new roles for women in interwar society. _Tempo, Tempo! The Bauhaus Photomontages of Marianne Brandt_ is the first publication to present, document and analyze the full range of Brandt’s work in photomontage.","https://monoskop.org/images/c/cd/Tempo_Tempo_The_Bauhaus_Photomontages_of_Marianne_Brandt_2005.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/68941154","Jovis Verlag, Berlin, and Bauhaus-Archiv Museum of Design, Berlin, 2005","https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/3236/tempo-tempo-the-bauhaus-photomontages-of-marianne-brandt"

During her 36 years of life she produced a tremendous amount of work covering a range of activities that included performance, installation, and sculpture. Her death cut short her prolific career and left the art world and those who knew her void of a feisty, political, and passionate human being.\n\nAfter Mendieta’s death, her sister and estate executer, Raquel Mendieta Harrington, formed an art advisory committee comprised of Mendieta’s friends to insure that her work would be compiled, catalogued, and exhibited. John Perreault and Petra Barreras del Rio were chosen to curate a retrospective exhibition of important selections representing a full range of work that had never before been presented together. The result was an exhibition held at the New Museum in New York City, November 1987 through January 1988. _Ana Mendieta: A Retrospective_ affirmed the abundance, strength, and significance of Mendieta’s work.","https://d2b8urneelikat.cloudfront.net/media/collectiveaccess/images/9/5/8928_ca_object_representations_media_9558_original.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/17485064","New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1987","https://archive.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/157"

Born in Cincinnati in 1937, studied drawing, sculpture, and printmaking at the Cincinnati Art Academy, and in 1959 moved to San Francisco where he began to experiment with performance, sound, the sense of taste, and other non-traditional media.\n\nA pioneer of the West Coast Conceptual Art movement, Marioni drew inspiration from artists such as Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968), John Cage (1912–1992), and Joseph Beuys (1921–1986), all of whom challenged the conventions of art. Emphasizing ideas as material for art, these artists exercised a profound influence on Marioni and other conceptual artists of the 1960’s. In 1968, Marioni became a curator at the Bay Area’s Richmond Art Center, where he mounted a series of ambitious Conceptual Art shows. In 1970, he founded the Museum of Conceptual Art in San Francisco, where he continued to experiment, viewing the concept of the museum as an extension of his work, until he closed it in 1984.\n\nFollowing in the tradition of the “readymade”—Duchamp’s name for common or found objects, which he recontextualized as art—Marioni employed mundane substances such as beer, elevating its significance from a common means of socialization to a catalyst for creative expression and social interaction. This meant that drinking beer with friends could be as profound an experience as gazing at the Mona Lisa. Thus, in Marioni’s view, the act of communication itself takes on aesthetic significance. Like Cage, whose work highlighted chance and ordinary sounds as music, Marioni attempts to make art that is as close to everyday life as possible without becoming life itself. Similar to Beuys, who privileged creative action over the precious and static art object, Marioni’s conversations and gatherings expand the conventions of painting and sculpture.","http://www.tommarioni.com/wp-content/images/Marioni.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/126846076","Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, 2006","https://www.contemporaryartscenter.org/exhibitions/2006/08/tom-marioni"

Art in a False Present, c. 1930_ is the question whether art has present, past, and future functions. The modernist assertion of the autonomy of art was intended to render superfluous art’s social and religious functions. But what if the functionlessness of art comes under suspicion of being instrumentalized by bourgeois capitalism? This was an accusation that informed the anti-modernist critique of the avant-garde, and particularly of Surrealism. The objective throughout the crisis-ridden present of the 1920s to the 1940s was to reaffirm a once ubiquitous, but long-lost functionality—not only of art.\n\nThe publication accompanying the exhibition examines the strategies deployed in this reaffirmation. These include the surrealist Primitivism of an “Ethnology of the White Man” together with the excavation of the deep time of humanity—into the “Neolithic Childhood” mapped out by the notoriously anti-modernist (1885-1940) as a hallucinatory retro-utopia. The volume brings together essays by the curators and academics involved in the project, primary texts by Carl Einstein and a comprehensive documentation of the exhibition including lists of works, texts on as well as images of numerous exhibits and finally installation views. At the center of the volume, a glossary discusses Carl Einstein’s own theoretical vocabulary as well as further associated terms, such as Autonomy, Formalism, Function, Gesture, Hallucination, Art, Metamorphosis, Primitivisms, Totality.","","http://worldcat.org/oclc/1039305621","Diaphanes, Berlin, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW), Berlin, 2018",""

His timeless architecture is not in a particular style or in response to a singular moment in the field; rather, it offers an opportunity to consider how built forms impact the individual and the collective, and reflect contemporary political, social and ideological conditions, and how one person contributes to the development and mutation of the built world.\n\n_Lebbeus Woods, Architect_ brings together works from the past forty years by one of the most influential designers working in architecture.

Describing his drawing practice in his own carefree prose, Lye said that doodling “cultivates a vacuous seaweed-pod state of kelp as a skull which is attached to a pencil betwixt the arm and the fingers held doodling in turn ‘twixt you and the paper in a rather bemused, empty, harmonious state of an attitude, eyes periphering said paper.”\n\nLye’s kinesthetic approach to drawing—related to Surrealist automatism and anticipating aspects of Abstract Expressionism—also informed his practice in painting, photography, film and sculpture.

The persistence, even today, of certain attitudes and poetics characteristic of that generation of artists as well as their extensive representation in the collection of the Museo Reina Sofía has made this period into one of the museum’s principal areas of research. As a result, it is essential for the museum to dig deeper in its analysis and critial (re)interpretation of this time.\n\nWith the restructuring and enlargement of the rooms devoted to this period, along with the present publication, the Museo Reina Sofía’s Collections Deaprtment seeks to significantly broaden the investigative scope traditionally applied to the visual culture of this period in Spain’s recent history.","","","Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, 2017",""

The labyrinth was made largely from scrap metal and spanned seven rooms of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. After feeling their way through Spoerri’s darkened maze, and weathering a number of wooden obstacles by Ultveldt, the participant ended up in a room where paintings ‘hung’ from the floor and marbles ‘stood’ on the walls.\n\nTo finish the trail, one had to splash around Raysse’s beach, fire a gun at Saint-Phalle’s shooting painting, turn right at Rauschenberg’s caged clocks and exit through Tinguely’s balloon-filled room. The terms ‘playground’ and ‘funfair’, frequently used by a rather sceptical press, were apt descriptions of what transpired in the museum galleries. Art as conceived in _Dylaby_ required active engagement on the part of the visitor. The exhibition followed in the wake of _Bewogen Beweging_ \[Art in Motion\] (1961), another Stedelijk Museum exhibition of interactive kinetic art, initiated by Tinguely the year before. The curatorial program was a response to the 1961 ‘a-dynamic manifesto’ of Dutch artists Ger van Elk and Wim T. Schippers, who berated the artistic pretentiousness of abstract expressionism that dominated museums.\n\nThe exhibition was a forebode of the ‘happenings’ that would take Amsterdam by storm from the mid-1960s. As the artwork now became a temporary experience that relied heavily on audience participation, its survival relied on photographic documentation. A legion of photographers orbited such cultural figures as Robert Jasper Grootveld and Theo Kley, choreographer Koert Stuyf and frequented the performance stronghold of Ferdi and Tajiri in Limburg.\n\nApart from the introductory text by Willem Sandberg, the _Dylaby_ catalogue almost exclusively consists of visuals. The double arrow on the cover, designed by Rauschenberg, was mounted on a car tire at the entrance of the labyrinth. Van der Elsken’s photographs reiterated the organised chaos of the exhibition. An image of disoriented visitors was rotated 90 degrees on the catalogue page, making them seem as though they were walking sideways on the gallery walls. Van der Elsken followed Tinguely around the Waterlooplein as he was scavenging for bicycle wheels and other metal scrap for his kinetic sculptures. A handwritten foldout in the catalogue features a timetable tracing the artists’ every move in the three weeks preceding the opening. After the show, the props landed in the garbage dump along with the rest of the labyrinth. What is left is an archive of bewildered press reviews; and this catalogue.","https://monoskop.org/images/8/8a/Dylaby_1962.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/901085421","Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, 1962",""

Buergel as the designated art director and Ruth Noack as curator. They served only “unofficially” as a two-member directorial team, however, as the documenta statutes do not allow for the possibility of two co-directors. Together, they developed a clearly defined programmatic concept under the banner of “The Migration of Forms.” What that meant was that, over the course of human history, visual culture has had only a limited number of basic forms with which to work—forms that have been used in different contexts and with different conceptual focuses throughout the history of art. Buergel/Noack pointed out that “contemporary does not mean that the works originated yesterday. They must be meaningful for people today. Documenta 12 is concerned with both historical lines of development in art and unexpected concurrences.” In order to bring these “unexpected concurrences” to light, relationships were established between works of art from different decades and cultures in which similar formal patterns have emerged—a process that has led to a “migration” of aesthetic forms across temporal and cultural boundaries culminating in the art of our postmodern world. This formalism was emphasized in the Neue Galerie by walls painted different colors. In turn, this focus on the phenomenon of migration resulted in the selection of a high percentage of artists from Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. New to the program was the inclusion of old art, from fourteenthcentury Persian miniatures to global art from recent decades. Artists already long since recognized in their own homelands, such as Nasreen Mohamedi, for example, were not the only ones presented to a broad public in Germany for the first time. The works of several exemplary artists—John McCracken, Kerry James Marshall, Charlotte Poseneske, and Gerwald Rockenschaub—also migrated through all exhibition venues.","https://monoskop.org/images/4/40/Documenta_12_2007.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/145453216","Taschen, Cologne, 2007",""

Schippers, Misha Mengelberg, Jaap Spek, Louis Andriessen and Govert Jurriaanse, most of them avant-garde musicians. Among their first activities was De Ridder’s _Papieren konstellaties_ \[Paper Constellations\], which could be ‘constructed’ anywhere as long as an audience was present to participate in this so-called PK theatre and help determine its appearance. Traditional theatre, it was felt, had to be given the boot. It had remained stuck too long in the renaissance model of the proscenium stage and should be replaced by dynamic, mobile installations, variable acoustics and–following John Cage–the theatricality of silence, which, it was anticipated, would make the audience restless. The group performed three concerts in February 1962. Fully in the spirit of , the hierarchy between artist/composer and performer as well as between performer and audience was abolished. Objects fulfilling a clearly visual function, such as a tape recorder, were featured in the concerts. The introduction of a visual element suited the ambition to destroy the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of art, following Cage’s example. After the concerts, MES was dissolved, despite the fact that various museums in the country were offering them the opportunity to put on new performances. De Ridder became a representative of Fluxus for the Netherlands in 1963.","https://monoskop.org/images/2/22/De_Ridder_Retrospective_1983.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/898998477","Groninger Museum, Groningen, 1983",""

With its many galleries, artist run-spaces, and artist bars, the city assumed a kind of mythological dimension, a place where artists came to show, sell, socialize, and distinguish themselves and their work on levels symbolic and real. The open question of how one makes one’s art in relation to a set of communities, histories, market conditions and social attitudes was at the core of the Cologne scene. It was fiercely debated, dramatized in exaggerated behavior, art works and exhibitions alike, and it contributed greatly to the impression that Cologne was a place of extreme self-consciousness and audacity.","https://monoskop.org/images/c/c9/Make_Your_Own_Life_Artists_in_and_Out_of_Cologne_2006.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/75256284","Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, 2006","http://icaphila.org/exhibitions/1753/make-your-own-life-artists-in-and-out-of-cologne"

This lively, involving, and intellectually provocative presentation encompasses a tremendous variety of artworks, large and small, intimate and expansive, in mediums both familiar and surprising: paintings, sculptures, photographs, drawings, prints, videos, and installations. Fully illustrated with the works of an international cross section of more than 60 artists.\n\nPublished on the occasion of the MoMA exhibition, this book features an introductory essay by Kynaston McShine, curator of the exhibition. In the ensuing plate secton, short entries by several authors on the art and artists accompany 233 illustrations representing works of artists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt, Eve Arnold, Garry Winogrand, and Thomas Struth. Personal museums and cabinets of curiosities, large and in miniature, have been created by Carles Wilson Peale, Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Cornell, Claes Oldenburg, Fluxus, and Mark Dion; others have focused on images of the destruction or transformation of museums, such as the painter Hubert Robert (the first curator of the Louvre), Edward Ruscha, Komar and Melamid, and Christo.\n\nThis wealth of material is followed by an anthology of manifestos, statements, and meditations written by artists; biographies and exhibition stories of the artists; and a bibliography of general and monographic publications.","http://moma.org/d/c/exhibition_catalogues/W1siZiIsIjMwMDA5ODc1NiJdLFsicCIsImVuY292ZXIiLCJ3d3cubW9tYS5vcmcvY2FsZW5kYXIvZXhoaWJpdGlvbnMvMTg1IiwiaHR0cDovL21vbWEub3JnL2NhbGVuZGFyL2V4aGliaXRpb25zLzE4NT9sb2NhbGU9ZW4iLCJpIl1d.pdf?sha=01bf5c8e7ff57a58","http://worldcat.org/oclc/41313693","Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1999","http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1999/muse/"

The early books, with their variously sized pages of coarse paper, illustrations entwined with printed, hand-written, and stamped texts, and provocative covers, were intended to shock academic conventions and bourgeois sensibilities. After the 1917 Revolution, books appeared with optimistic designs and photomontage meant to reach the masses and symbolize a rational, machine-led future. Later books showcased modern Soviet architecture and industry in the service of the government’s agenda.\n\nMajor artists adopted the book format during these two decades. They include , , , , , , , and others. These artists often collaborated with poets, who created their own transrational language to accompany the imaginative illustrations. Three major artistic movements, , , and , that developed during this period in painting and sculpture also found their echo in the book format.\n\nThis publication accompanied an exhibition of Russian avant-garde books at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.

The name of the magazine referred to the date of their first public exhibition. It was conceived as “magazine-catalogue” for their self-organized “exhibition-actions” which ranged from performing and creating installations on city streets and squares to taking trips to the seaside, where they created, performed, and documented work. Comprised solely of pages presenting artworks, the magazine can be viewed as an alternative exhibition space, enabling the artists to communicate their work to the public without the mediation and the sanctioning authority of art institutions and curators. Between 1978 and 1984, 17 issues were published (identified by the letters of the Croatian alphabet), with an additional one produced in 1990 and commemoratively titled _Ex-Maj_. Issue F, edited by Vlasta Delimar, was a women-only issue.”\n\n“Exhibition venues were fairly limited for artists so the pages of _Maj 75_ became an alternative space for not only the Group of Six, but also an extended circle of Yugoslavian and other Eastern European artists, to produce and disseminate their work publicly. Artists such as Vlasta Delimar, Tomislav Gotovac, Sanja Iveković, Mangelos, Balint Szombathy, Raša Todosijević and Goran Trbuljak are a few examples of the many contributors during the history of publication.

The works, which were drawn mostly from the British Museum’s own collection of contemporary Islamic art, demonstrate how each artist celebrates the aesthetic powers and plasticity of the letters, while simultaneously pushing the boundaries, even sometimes subverting traditional canons. The artists manipulate letters, often transforming them beyond recognition, using ingenious and innovative methods, materials, styles, and daring compositions. Some use letters for purely aesthetic reasons, while others use them more instrumentally as writing, signs, or ciphers that allow the artists to grapple with issues of socio-political orientation and cultural and religious identity.

It included 650 works of art confiscated from 32 German museums. For the National Socialists, the term “degenerate” applied to any type of art that was incompatible with their ideology or propaganda. Whole movements were labeled as such, including Expressionism, Impressionism, Dada, New Objectivity, Surrealism, Cubism, and Fauvism, among others. Many of Germany’s most talented and innovative artists suffered official defamation: for example, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Ernst, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein, Paul Klee, and Ernst Barlach. Avant-garde artists and museum directors who purchased or exhibited modern art had already been barred from professional activity as early as 1933. With this exhibition, the visual arts were forced into complete submission to censorship and National Socialist “coordination” \[Gleichschaltung\]. Initiated by Minster of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels and President of the Reich Chamber of the Visual Arts Adolf Ziegler (1892-1959), the exhibition travelled to twelve other cities from 1937 to 1941. In all, the show drew more than 3 million visitors. The exhibition sought to demonstrate the “degeneration” of artworks by placing them alongside drawings done by the mentally retarded and photographs of the physically handicapped. These comparisons aimed to highlight the “diseased,” “Jewish-Bolshevist,” and inferior character of these artworks and to warn of an impending “cultural decline.” As an exercise in contrast, the opposite – good, “healthy,” “German” art – could be seen in the “Great German Art Exhibition,” on view only a few meters away.","","http://worldcat.org/oclc/22734939","Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and H.N.

A member of the Bauhaus who fled to the U.S. in 1933, his ideas about how the mind understands color influenced generations of students, inspired countless artists, and anticipated the findings of neuroscience in the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nWith contributions from the disciplines of art history, the intellectual and cultural significance of Gestalt psychology, and neuroscience, Intersecting Colors offers a timely reappraisal of the immense impact of Albers’s thinking, writing, teaching, and art on generations of students. It shows the formative influence on his work of non-scientific approaches to color (notably the work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) and the emergence of Gestalt psychology in the first decades of the twentieth century. The work also shows how much of Albers’s approach to color—dismissed in its day by a scientific approach to the study and taxonomy of color driven chiefly by industrial and commercial interests—ultimately anticipated what neuroscience now reveals about how we perceive this most fundamental element of our visual experience.","http://acpress.amherst.edu/assets/IntersectingColorsIA.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/919171074","Amherst College Press, Amherst, MA, Sep 2015","http://www.amherst.edu/museums/mead/exhibitions/2015/intersecting-colors-josef-albers-and-his-contemporaries"

After the death of her husband in 2002, her desire to hoard items became an obsession that began to have an impact on her standard of living. Song and his sister managed to alleviate it by persuading her to let him use her possessions as an art installation, reflecting her life and the modern history of China as experienced by one family.

But also very concrete. Political, but also bureaucratic. What does it have to do with art?\n\nThe welfare state operates with regulations, rights and obligations that apply to everyone in the same way, requiring individuals to identify themselves as members of society first and foremost. In this sense, the welfare state is the antithesis of art. Many artists support the welfare state in both theory and practice, and they are fascinated by rules as such, but they have little interest in following rules formulated by others than themselves..\n\nThe welfare state is an emancipatory political project, although it was first invented as a way of keeping class struggle and revolution at bay. It is hard to disassociate the European welfare state from the darker elements of recent history, such as militarism, colonialism and the degradation of the natural environment. Yet the welfare state, as a model for social cohesion and political stability, is now gaining ground in new parts of the world, notably in East Asia.\n\nThe exhibition _The Welfare State_ does not look back with nostalgia at the welfare state in its ‘classical’ form as a utopian blueprint for an egalitarian (and homogenous) society in postwar Western Europe. It does not invite artists to ‘illustrate’ political and social engagement. But it does ask some fundamental questions. What is the ‘imaginary’ of the welfare state? Does it have a ‘form’?

The _Faces of War_ break from the utopian optimism of the early Bauhaus and reveal the existential struggle of an artist coping with identity and the devastation of war.

The collective proposition, a radical one for the times, was that the pathway to Pop Art led inexorably through Surrealism, which this exhibition also sought to cast in a different light.\n\nOrganized by New York art critic Gene Swenson (1934-69), the exhibition was accompanied by a modest catalogue whose passionate, forty-page essay dismantles Cubism’s claims to formalist innovation. Surrealism is shown to be much cooler (making dreams concrete) and Pop much hotter (making feelings into things) than typically held—and also much more effective. Art’s job is, Swenson wrote, “to turn feelings into things so we that can deal with them.”","https://monoskop.org/images/4/40/The_Other_Tradition_1966.pdf","","Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 1966",""

In the noted film and subsequent photographs titled _I’m Too Sad to Tell You_ (1971), the artist is seen crying directly into the camera amplifying a simple human emotion – grief – into a profound and revelatory experience. Ader also makes use of the force of gravity as a medium in his performance work, as documented in film and photography. His videos, in many respects, bear an explicit physicality, which are the hallmark of many silent films. Other projects, including the unfinished trilogy _In Search of the Miraculous_ (1975), during which the artist disappeared, stretch the boundaries of sentimentalism through existential journey.\n\nAder frequently referenced Dutch artistic and cultural traditions in his work. Photographs such as On the road to a new _Neo Plasticism, Westkapelle, Holland_ (1971) reveal his interest in Mondrian and the De Stijl movement, which sought simplified compositions to express a utopian harmony. Dutch landscape and still life painting traditions can be seen in videos such as _Primary Time_ (1974), in which he arranges and rearranges a red, blue and yellow bouquet of flowers, and in photographs like _Farewell to Faraway Friends_ (1971), where the artist casts himself as a romantic wanderer – linking himself to the paintings of 19th century German artist Caspar David Friedrich – but ultimately setting the tone for his physical acts of searching.","http://pitweb.pitzer.edu/galleries/wp-content/uploads/sites/77/2010/09/2010_Catalogue-BasJanAder.pdf","","Pitzer College, 2010",""

Both hailed and derided by artists and critics, the exhibition was the largest, most expensive and most diverse of any exhibition anywhere, and foreshadowed all large-scale, collaboratively curated, comprehensive mega-shows to come.\n\nChiefly curated by the Swiss curator, Harald Szeemann, it was a pioneering, radically different presentation that was conceived as a 100-day event, with performances and happenings, outsider art, even non-art, as well as repeated Joseph Beuys lectures, and an installation of Claes Oldenburg’s _Mouse Museum_, among many other atypical inclusions.

Commissioned by Szeeman, Ruscha’s graphic image for the show featured ants arranged in the word ‘Docu / menta’ and the number ‘5.’ The emblem was used on the exhibition’s poster and catalogue cover.","","http://worldcat.org/oclc/294996594","documenta and Bertelsmann, Kassel, 1972",""

They are the background to contemporary society. Using them, getting round their failures, exploiting their specific qualities, forms part of the necessary knowledge of the present day. These things mediate, transform, encode, filter and translate relations. Fuller and Goffey include a broad definition of media to include things like middle management, neurotropic or suppressant drugs that treat the body as an information system, alongside things such as queuing systems or specific algorithms or data–structures.\n\nAssisted by Transmediale, Tom Keene, Anna Blumenkranz and other members of the Open Systems Association, YoHa (Graham Harwood & Matsuko Yokokoji) had invited people to write a text of one hundred words about an object, its genealogy, any key factors that make it amenable to manipulation. This text was then presented together with the object in a cabinet of curiosities that at the same time evoked associations with a distribution centre. A key fact of grey media is its ready quality of dryness, one bordering temptingly on boredom and this is something we asked people to maintain when writing the text.\n\nThe project has been installed at Transmediale 2013 in Berlin and The Netherlands Architecture Institute in Rotterdam.","","","",""

Because their art evaded the traditional path from cloistered studio to rarefied gallery or museum, the artists often were dependent on photography and the mass media to communicate its very existence.\n\nThe _Earth Art_ exhibition—held at the Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art at New York’s Cornell University, in 1969—was the first museum exhibition dedicated to this new way of producing and presenting artworks. Conceived by Willoughby Sharp (1936–2008), an independent curator, publisher, and artist, the exhibition presented site-specific installations by nine artists: Jan Dibbets from the Netherlands, Hans Haacke and Günther Uecker from Germany, Richard Long from Great Britain, David Medalla from the Philippines, and Neil Jenny, Robert Morris, Dennis Oppenheim, and Robert Smithson from the United States. Initially twelve artists were invited: Michael Heizer and Walter de Maria briefly exhibited in the show but were not mentioned in the catalogue, which was published a year later. Carl Andre was also invited but ultimately declined to participate.\n\nMost of the participating artists were on site for about a week in late January/early February of 1969 to make new pieces for the exhibition with the help of students from Cornell University, including Gordon Matta-Clark and Louise Lawler, graduates of the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. Medalla sent installation instructions for his piece by mail, while Morris had to phone his in—he could not make it to Ithaca because of a blizzard.\n\nInstalled inside the A. D. White Museum and scattered around the Cornell campus and the surrounding Ithaca area, the commissioned pieces sought to eschew the commodity status of the art object and to question the role of institutions. The dissolution of boundaries—between object and context, between different mediums, and between the work of art and its documentation—was a hallmark of the art of the time, reflecting 1960s counterculture more broadly. It is at this intersection—where art meets life and art turns into activism—that the influence of the 1960s earth artists has perhaps had the most significant impact on a current generation of artists working on issues related to ecology.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue includes a foreword by Thomas W. Leavitt (1930–2010), then the director of the A. D. White Museum of Art; essays by Sharp and William C. Lipke, then professor of art history at Cornell University; artist biographies; transcripted excerpts from a symposium on earth art held at Cornell on February 6, 1969; and more than forty black-and-white photographs.","https://monoskop.org/images/a/ab/Earth_Art_1969_catalogue.pdf","","Cornell University, New York, 1970",""

The accuracy and immediacy of photographs gave scientists a new means to document and study ancient architecture, artifacts, and language. At the same, the first photographers to visit ancient Mediterranean sites saw themselves as artists using the new medium to capture what had up to then been represented only by draftsmen or painters. The early photographs were rapidly disseminated among a wider audience eager to see, rather than merely imagine, the remnants of antiquity. Today these images are still prized, both for their vision and originality and for their inherent documentary value. The early photographs of the Roman Forum, the Acropolis in Athens, and the pyramids of Giza have made these sites a part of our shared cultural experience, fixing them in our minds as places of historic—and mythic—significance.\n\n_Antiquity and Photography_ explores the influence of photography on archaeology between 1840 and 1880. This was the period that saw the evolution of archaeology as a professional discipline as well as the rapid growth of the new photographic medium. With illustrations drawn from the collections of the Getty Museum and the Getty Research Institute, the essays in this book examine the growth of archaeology as a scientific discipline and its increasing reliance on photographic documentation, and they consider some of the conventions that came to govern the ostensibly objective photographs of antiquities and ancient sites. Biographical essays explore the careers of two major early photographers, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey and William James Stillman. In addition, portfolios with works by Maxime Du Camp, John Beasley Greene, Francis Frith, Robert Macpherson, Adolphe Braun, and others testify to the strength and consistency of other early photographers who captured the antique worlds around the Mediterranean.","http://d2aohiyo3d3idm.cloudfront.net/publications/virtuallibrary/0892368055.pdf","http://worldcat.org/oclc/58455454","Getty Publications, Los Angeles, 2005",""

Variously titled _Création et matériaux nouveaux, Matériau et création, Matériaux nouveaux et création_, and, in its last form, _La Matière dans tous ses états_, this exhibition, first scheduled to take place in 1984, already contained many of the innovative features that found their way into _Les Immatériaux_.\n\nThese features included an emphasis on language as matter, the immateriality of advanced technological materials (from textiles to plastics and holography), exhibits devoted to recent technological developments in food, architecture, music and video, and an experimental catalogue produced using computers. The earlier versions of the exhibition also involved many of the future protagonists of _Les Immatériaux_, such as Jean-Louis Boissier (among several other faculty members of Université Paris VIII, where Lyotard was teaching at the time) and Eve Ritscher (a London-based consultant on holography). Furthermore, _Les Immatériaux_ benefited from projects pursued concurrently by other groups within the Pompidou which joined Lyotard’s and Chaput’s project when it was discovered that their themes overlapped. Thus, an exhibition project on music videos initiated by the Musée national d’art moderne and a project on electro-acoustic music developed by IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique) were incorporated into it.","","","Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, March 1985",""

The realization that a new society was imminent was felt by many to demand radical new solutions to social, economic and cultural problems. In the Netherlands the first contribution to the stating of those problems was made by the artists and architects who had united in the De Stijl movement.","http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:7f3c0465-cd78-41d3-b24d-b1e5bb78a904/Het_nieuwe_bouwen_-_de_stijl.MF.pdf","","Delft University Press, Delft, and Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag, 1983",""

The Whitney show featured John D. Rockefeller III’s collection of mainly eighteenth and nineteenth-century American art–a collection that featured only one African American and one woman artist.\n\nThe Catalog Committee, which consisted of fifteen artists and two art historians, spent almost a year producing an eighty-page book containing articles and documents. Originally conceived as a critique of art historian E.P. Richardson’s catalog for the Whitney exhibition, the committee evolved ideas for pictorial essays that would encompass native American art, African-American art, art by women, critiques of pervasive class bias in the art world, and critical examinations of cultural institutions. As the committee wrote in its description of its project, ‘we share the belief that culture should no longer exist merely as an extension of the economic interests or the personal ‘tastes’ of the wealthy and powerful. Nor can we hope to transform culture outside of a struggle to transform the society from which it springs.’ Strong words that have lost little of their relevance for today’s cultural scene.","https://monoskop.org/images/f/fc/An_Anti-Catalog.pdf","","Artists Meeting for Cultural Change, New York, 1977",""

The electrical vibrations shown on the screen of the oscilloscope, which included Lissajous figures, he recorded by still photography. Some of Laposky’s images were published in _Scripta Mathematica_ in 1952.\n\nIn 1953 Laposky exhibited fifty images that called ‘Oscillons’ (or oscillogram designs) at the Sanford Museum in Cherokee, Iowa. To record this exhibition Laposky published an exhibition catalogue entitled _electronic abstractions_. Because of this exhibition Laposky is credited as the earliest pioneer in electronic art, more specifically in the analog vector medium. In later work Laposky also incorporated motorized rotating filters of variable speed to color the patterns. He never programmed computers to create images.\n\nA version of Laposky’s electronic abstractions show was exhibited across the United States, in France at LeMons, and other places by the Cultural Relations Section of the United States from 1953 to 1961.","https://monoskop.org/images/3/35/Laposky_Ben_F_Electronic_Abstractions_A_New_Approach_to_Design.pdf","","",""

LeWitt transforms these ideas into objects of exquisite beauty and elegance, deliberately introducing elements of chance, intuition, or irrationality into the systems that govern the creation of his works. LeWitt’s delicate balancing act between thought and form, between order and disorder, between authorship and anonymity, has exerted an enormous influence on artists of subsequent generations. This book, the first retrospective of LeWitt’s work in more than twenty years, fosters a deeper understanding of the artist’s career and its significance to American art and thought.\n\nIncluding essays by Gary Garrels, Martin Friedman, Andrea Miller-Keller, Brenda Richardson, Anne Rorimer, John S. Weber, and Adam D. Weinberg, the book charts the evolution of LeWitt’s art from his groundbreaking work in Conceptualism during the early 1960s through his turn toward a more lyrical and sensual form of abstraction around 1980.

However, far from confining himself to illuminating the subject solely with photographic means, Sekula has been integrating the written word in his creative work since the Seventies. Consequently, Fish Story has been conceived from the outset as a book and as an exhibition. The photographs shown in this publication illustrate working conditions on highly industrialized container ships and in ports, while the texts yield insights masked by the visual, photographic information.

Desde posicionamientos múltiples y simultáneos, Romero trama un complejo dispositivo crítico cuyo irregular despliegue desarma la integración retrospectiva de su obra en un relato coherente y unitario.\n\nEn las estrategias poético-políticas que activa, la producción de Romero cruza diferentes problemáticas. La puesta en cuestión del grabado en sus fundamentos conceptuales y técnicos y la opción de la imagen múltiple como dispositivo político en la transformación de los modos de vida. La intervención en espacios alternativos a los circuitos artísticos institucionales y la búsqueda de una mayor participación del espectador. Las interferencias mutuas entre grabado artístico, imagen mediática y gráfica popular. La palabra como registro opaco, abierto a turbulencias de la significación que desorganizan los pactos de sentido hegemónicos fijados por la “transparencia” neoliberal. La incorporación del cuerpo como territorio de inscripción de las relaciones (conflictivas) de poder que reglamentan el orden individual y social.\n\n_La exposición 1. Juan Carlos Romero. Cartografías del cuerpo, asperezas de la palabra_ interpela estos problemas en un conjunto de obras que abarca más de cuarenta años (1966-2009) de la producción del artista. Cuerpo y palabra constituyen las dos dimensiones que la exposición tensiona en los trayectos cruzados que diagrama al interrogar la densidad conflictual de esta serie de obras. Desde esta perspectiva, no se trata de presentar un recorrido exhaustivo y acabado de la obra de Romero. En el recorte conscientemente parcial que propone como apuesta interpretativa, esta muestra no pretende fijar un relato, sino, por el contrario, hacer explícitas las tensiones y derivas, las fricciones e interferencias que dicho cuerpo de producción activa en la potencia crítica de sus accidentes y porosidades, para, lejos de clausurar su espesor disruptivo en la “llamada al orden” de su ordenamiento retrospectivo, abrirlo a los desfases e intermitencias de sentido que lo animan.\n\nEn este marco, la exposición busca incidir críticamente en otros dos debates. Por un lado, el referido a las problemáticas relaciones entre práctica artística y política. En una dirección que se aparta de su reducción como ámbitos mutuamente excluyentes –solo conciliables en tanto hay un afuera-del-arte que reclama su “politización”-, esta muestra propone pensar la relación arte / política en el territorio movedizo en el que ambas dimensiones se interpelan de manera recíproca.","https://monoskop.org/images/d/dd/Romero_Juan_Carlos_Cartografias_del_cuerpo_asperezas_de_la_palabra_catalogue.pdf","","Espacio de Arte Fundacion OSDE, Buenos Aires, 2009",""

Always acutely aware of his own complicity and involvement, in his address to art Stilinović intimates a set of troubled, poetic, enigmatic and modest observations on the standing of art in the contemporary world, its reception and distribution. But he also questions the value of art, which far too often is translated exclusively in monetary terms, or as he puts it: “quick manipulation, quick money, quick oblivion”.\n\nAs in several previous shows curated by What, How and for Whom/WHW, _Dear Art_ takes its title from a work by Mladen Stilinović, and once again its wager is set on the “classical” exhibition format. Amidst the disillusionment created by the persistent feeling of failure (coming from the fact that attempts for a radical reconfiguration of art and cultural production in general always become almost immediately spectacularized), _Dear Art_ insists on the obstinate repetition of what has become the curatorial method. Obsessed with the interconnectedness of art and politics and plagued by the nature of art’s “inefficiency,” it attempts to ask necessary questions: Why do we still need art, and what is it that we expect to get from art today?

Now, more than two hundred years after von Kempelen ’s death, the joint exhibition of C3 Foun­dation and the ZKM in Karlsruhe, setting the two outstanding mecha­nical inventions of the polyhistor – the chess-player automaton and the speaking machine – at the centre, attempts to focus not only on the most en­during memories of his almost unfathomably far-reaching career. Alongside the portrayal of von Kempelen as scientist, engi­neer, artist, showman, civil servant and private individual, the exhibi­tion broadens the picture onto the Court of Maria Theresa and Jo­seph II, the mechanical inventions of the epoch, the invention of the era of invention, the Freemasonry movement, and the Turk- and puppet-mania of the century.\n\nEven though we are separated from von Kempelen ’s world by more than two hundred years, we can still recognise the similarities bet­ween that atmosphere of scientific discoveries constantly out­bidding each other, with technical and technological innovations appearing in the second half of the 18th century, and the multi­fariousness of art forms, and our own present.\n\nThe other aim of the exhibition is the elaboration of the history of innovative thinking, and the presentation of elements of technical and conceptual history inspired by von Kempelen and his mecha­nisms. Alongside the historical correlations, the show presents con­temporary media artworks – in part, commissioned specifically for this occasion – that, taking the sphere of thought of von Kempe­len ’s inventions as their point of departure, discover the relationship bet­ween the ideas of the Enlightenment and the questions of the pre­sent day.","https://monoskop.org/images/2/27/Kempelen_Man_in_the_Machine_2007.pdf","","C3 Foundation, and Műcsarnok, Budapest, 2007","http://www.kempelen.hu/index_en.html"

With dry humor and minimal aesthetics, irational commented the Internet hype of the mid-to-late 1990s, competing with the commercialization-euphoria of the new market by developing its own pseudo-ventures. Net art was immediate during this period, neither needing nor enjoying the safety of a mediating space or instance. This is why irational often hit upon humorless trademark attorneys, who wanted to keep irational from using brand names such as 7-11, American Express, Sainsbury’s and Tesco. These encounters, which the exhibition documents extensively, were little more than a prelude to more recent developments in the field of copyright, intellectual property, and brand protection. Heath Bunting was the first net artist to retire in 1997, putting an end to his exclusive work on the net and turning back to more intensive work in public space, which the Internet has become such an important part of today. If the activities of irational during its “net phase” were dedicated to calling virtual boundaries into question, its members now experiment with interrogating and overcoming economic, political, and social boundaries in real space, producing a great deal of comic relief, among other things.","http://proxy.ge.tt/1/files/7DAJkH72/0/blob?pdf","","Revolver – Archiv fuer aktuelle Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, October 2006",""

The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the minimalism of Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, the smooth plasticity of Alexander Liberman, the collaborative efforts of the Anonima group, alongside the well-known Victor Vasarely, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Bridget Riley. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. The exhibition was enormously popular with the general public, though less so with the critics. Critics dismissed op art as portraying nothing more than trompe l’oeil, or tricks that fool the eye. Regardless, op art’s popularity with the public increased, and op art images were used in a number of commercial contexts. Bridget Riley tried to sue an American company, without success, for using one of her paintings as the basis of a fabric design.” (Wikipedia)\n\nPublisher Museum of Modern Art, New York; in collaboration with The City Art Museum of St. Louis, The Contemporary Art Council of the Seattle Art Museum, The Pasadena Art Museum, and The Baltimore Museum of Art, 1965  \n58 pages\n\nExh. review: (ARTnews, 1965).\n\n[Brian de Palma’s “The Responsive Eye](http://ubu.com/film/depalma_responsive.html)","https://monoskop.org/images/1/11/Seitz_William_C_The_Responsive_Eye_1965.pdf","","",""

In a time of political turmoil and anticlimax, this book redefines politics as operating in the realm of things. Politics is not just an arena, a profession, or a system, but a concern for things brought to the attention of the fluid and expansive constituency of the public. But how are things made public? What, we might ask, is a republic, a res publica, a public thing, if we do not know how to make things public? There are many other kinds of assemblies, which are not political in the usual sense, that gather a public around things—scientific laboratories, supermarkets, churches, and disputes involving natural resources like rivers, landscapes, and air. The authors of Making Things Public—and the ZKM show that the book accompanies—ask what would happen if politics revolved around disputed things. Instead of looking for democracy only in the official sphere of professional politics, they examine the new atmospheric conditions—technologies, interfaces, platforms, networks, and mediations that allow things to be made public. They show us that the old definition of politics is too narrow; there are many techniques of representation—in politics, science, and art—of which Parliaments and Congresses are only a part.”\n\nThe authors include Richard Rorty, Simon Schaffer, Peter Galison, Richard Powers, Lorraine Daston, Richard Aczel, and Donna Haraway; their writings are accompanied by excerpts from John Dewey, Shakespeare, Swift, La Fontaine, and Melville. More than 500 color images document the new idea of what Bruno Latour and Peter Weibel call an “object-oriented democracy.","http://brb.memoryoftheworld.org/Peter%20Weibel/Making%20Things%20Public_%20Atmospheres%20of%20Democracy%20_%20[Exhibition],%20ZKM,%20Center%20for%20Art%20and%20Media%20Ka%20(7530)/Making%20Things%20Public_%20Atmospheres%20of%20Democ%20-%20Peter%20Weibel.pdf","","MIT Press, 2005",""

The program and content of the festival is prepared through a series of Tactical Media Labs (TMLs) organised locally in different cities around the globe. This series of Tactical Media Labs started on September 11, 2002 in Amsterdam and they continued internationally right up to the festival in September. TMLs have been organised in: Amsterdam, Sydney, Cluj, Barcelona, Delhi, New York, Singapore, Birmingham, Nova Scotia, Berlin, Chicago, Portsmouth, Sao Paulo, Moscow, Dubrovnik, and Zanzibar.\n\nThe program of Next 5 Minutes 4 was structured along four core thematic threads, bringing together a host of projects and debates. These four thematic threads were:\n\n‘The Reappearing of the Public’ deals with the elusiveness of the public that tactical media necessarily needs to interface with, and considers new strategies for engaging with or redefining ‘the public’.\n\n‘Deep Local (Growing Roots for the Global Village)’, which explores the ambiguities of connecting essentially translocal media cultures with local contexts.\n\n‘The Tactics of Appropriation’ questions who is appropriating whom? Corporate, state, or terrorist actors all seem to have become effective media tacticians, is the battle for the screen therefore lost?\n\n‘The Tactical and the Technical’ finally questions the deeply political nature of (media-)technology, and the role that the development of new media tools plays in defining, enabling and constraining its tactical use.","https://monoskop.org/images/8/8f/Next_5_Minutes_4_Reader_2003.pdf","","",""

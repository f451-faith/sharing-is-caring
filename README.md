> "*Sometimes it is a conscious choice not to delegate particular jobs to the computer, and sometimes it is just a habit. Most often it is not more than a click or two that uncover your general purpose architecture."* 
Lialina, O., 2012. Turing Complete User. [online]Â [Available here](http://www.contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/)

**Introduction** 

Whether you are using existing databases or creating new ones, the question of access is always present. This question is often focused on how to fetch data, but not so often on how to share it and it is precisely in this reversed questioning that the *Sharing is Caring* workshop is stepping off from. Within this 3-day workshop we will consider APIs as the central tool to answer this question. 

Despite sounding rather complex, an API - which stands for **Application Programming Interface** - is essentially just an **interface**, or method/way, for users and software to communicate. Whilst being an overly technical tool, APIs will serve here as a stepping stone for a global reflection towards data organisation and web structure

**The workshop**

Inspired by open-source initiatives, we will collectively create an online Open Access API for the BYTE magazine database. We will each contribute multiples endpoints/parameters to the API, exploring what it might mean to allow a database to connect to other users and a wider ecosystem.
